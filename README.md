# Mindtrix
Mindtrix is a podcast DAO on Flow. üéô  
A community derives from podcasters, listeners, and collectors.
We're building a one-stop minting tool to bring the podcast ecosystem into the web3 world!

## Contract
The contracts aim to build a minting tool for podcasters to mint their podcast NFTs with ease. The graph provides a basic explanation of the usage scenario and hopes it helps when reviewing the code. üôÇ

 - Mindtrix.cdc 
   - It represents the core functionalities of NFTs. Podcasters can mint the two kinds of NFTs, Audio 
and Image Essence, based on their podcast episodes. Collectors can buy the NFTs from podcasters' public sales or secondary market on Flow.

 - Essence.cdc 
   - An Essence is a segment in one episode of a podcast show. One episode may have multiple essences.
   
 - Verifier.cdc
   - A Verifier is the minting restrictions made by podcasters.
One essence may have multiple verifiers. It is inspired by `FLOATVerifiers.cdc` of Emerald City. (we always learn from Jacob ü§ì)
   
 - Brand.cdc
   - A Brand is a podcast show and it is the top level category. One podcaster may host multiple shows.

For now, we just finished `Mindtrix.cdc`, and it would be helpful if you have the advice to improve the contract.üôè
